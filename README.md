# pydf_utils

Initially used to clean black borders/margins from a scanned book and find/split from the middle of the page (in the case of being scanned 2 pages at a time). That means its tailored towards that particular example and might not work exactly the same in other scanned documents. There is still some parameters that can change the behaviour but i can't promise it would work appropiately.

I expect to clean and tidy everything and add more parameters and versatility as well as a little bit of documentation explaining how it works.
